Basic Income
============

A Basic Income is an income, given as a basic right to all regardless of their income or outgoings.

The concept of a Basic Income has been supported by a range of economists and politicians, but also has a wide range of opponents.

The main argument against a Basic Income is the cost, but it is also feared that people will be less interested in working, or that targeted benefit such as disability benefit are reduced to help pay for an income that not everybody needs. 

Those in favour of a Basic Income do not feel that it is dignified for a human being to have to beg for food, or to have to sleep on the streets. We feel that as more jobs are lost to robot workers it will be harder for more of us to support our families, whilst providing less taxes to pay for such a support.

Experiments have shown: "Crime went down 42%. Illegal hunting aka poaching went down 95%. Hospitalization rates decreased 8.5%. Birth weights improved due to better maternal nutrition. Consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables went up. Consumption of alcohol and other temptation goods went down. Personalities improved such that kids were more honest and worked better together. School attendance increased and grades improved. Teen pregnancy rates went down. Frequency of people being personally offended by each other went down. Trust increased. Savings went up and debt went down. Entrepreneurship quadrupled in one place and was three times higher than control groups in another. Recipients worked more hours, and earned more additional income. And disproportionately positive effects overall were seen among women, the elderly, and the disabledâ€¦ in other words, the traditionally marginalized." Scott Santens (April 2018) (https://medium.com/basic-income/its-time-for-technology-to-serve-all-humankind-with-unconditional-basic-income-e46329764d28)


However, all of the proposals to date have been regional or national. Surely if we consider that a Basic Income should be a right for all people, then it must make sense for it to be available to all people. 

We believe that with the right funding and support, we can deliver such a Basic Income and enable distribution to everyone.
