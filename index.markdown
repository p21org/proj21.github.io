## Project 21 seeks to reduce poverty, debt and inequality by delivering a Global Basic Income.





Project21 was founded in 2021 after a miserable 2020 where many people in the world were deeply affected by Covid-19. During that year, many jobs were lost as whole populations were locked down, inequality widened significantly, and many more voices joined the call for a Basic Income.


These pages explain a little of how Project21 will work. 

Will *you* help make it happen ?
